# SIEM Threat Dashboard

This is a frontend application simulating a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system dashboard. It provides an overview of conceptual security plan phases, mock alerts, a log viewer, simulated detection rules, playbooks, and AI-powered insights for threat analysis using the Gemini API.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or newer recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- A Gemini API Key

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    # git clone <repository-url>
    # cd siem-threat-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Gemini API Key:**
    This application requires a Gemini API key to power the AI insights feature. The key **must** be provided via an environment variable named `API_KEY`.

    **On Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    export API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```
    **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
    ```bash
    set API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```
    **On Windows (PowerShell):**
    ```bash
    $env:API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```
    You'll need to do this in the terminal session where you run the build or dev commands. For persistent storage across sessions, consider your shell's profile file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) or system environment variable settings.

    *If the `API_KEY` is not set during the build, the AI analysis feature will be disabled or show an error.*

## Local Development & Running

1.  **Build the application:**
    This command bundles the JavaScript/TypeScript code and prepares `index.html` in the `dist` folder. The `API_KEY` environment variable must be set before running this.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Start the local server:**
    This command serves the built application from the `dist` folder.
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Simplified dev command:**
    You can also use `npm run dev` which runs the build and then starts the server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    After making changes to source files (e.g., in `.tsx` files), you'll need to re-run `npm run build` (or `npm run dev`) to see the changes.

## Deployment to Static Hosting Services

This application is designed to be deployed as a static site on services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or any web server that can host static files.

1.  **Build the application for production:**
    Ensure your `API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly in your terminal or CI/CD environment.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will generate all necessary static assets in the `dist/` directory.

2.  **Deploy the `dist/` directory:**
    Upload the contents of the `dist/` directory to your chosen static hosting provider.

    **Important for Hosting Platforms (Netlify, Vercel, etc.):**
    -   Set the `API_KEY` as an environment variable in your hosting provider's build settings.
    -   Set the build command to `npm run build` (or `node build.mjs`).
    -   Set the publish directory (or output directory) to `dist`.

## Project Structure

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file (source).
-   `index.tsx`: The entry point for the React application.
-   `App.tsx`: The main application component.
-   `components/`: Directory for React components.
-   `services/`: Directory for services like `geminiService.ts`.
-   `constants.tsx`: Mock data and application constants.
-   `types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions.
-   `metadata.json`: Application metadata.
-   `build.mjs`: The build script using esbuild.
-   `package.json`: Project configuration, dependencies, and scripts.
-   `dist/`: Output directory for the built application (generated by `npm run build`).

## Gemini API Usage

The Gemini API is used in `components/GeminiInsight.tsx` via `services/geminiService.ts` to provide AI-driven analysis of selected security alerts. The model used is `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`. Ensure your `API_KEY` is valid and has access to this model.
The application strictly follows guidelines for API key handling, obtaining it only from `process.env.API_KEY` during the build process.
